    How old are you in days? It's easy to calculate - just subtract your birthday from today.
    But let's extend this and count difference between any dates.
</p>

<p>
    You are given two dates as tuples with three numbers - year, month and day.
    For example: 19 april 1982 will be (1982, 4, 19).
    You should find the difference in days between the given dates.
    For example between today and tomorrow = 1 day.
    The difference is positive always (or zero), so don't forget about absolute value.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two dates as tuples of integers.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The difference between the dates in days as an integer.
</p>

        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
days_diff((1982, 4, 19), (1982, 4, 22)) == 3
days_diff((2014, 1, 1), (2014, 8, 27)) == 238
days_diff((2014, 8, 27), (2014, 1, 1)) == 238
    </pre>

    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    Dates between 1 january 1 and 31 december 9999.
    Dates are correct.
